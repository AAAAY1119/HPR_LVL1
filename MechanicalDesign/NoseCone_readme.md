Nose cones could be made from curves like a parabola, or a section of a circle(simple ogive, secant ogive, and tangent ogive). But if someone's too lazy then they could also just choose a straight line(Triangular Nose Cone)! But we aren't lazy and we want our rocket to perform the best! Here's something you should know:

# HAACK SERIES:
I've made an animation for the Haack Series Curve on Desmos, feel free to play with it:

**Von Karman:**
If you put the constant to a zero(i.e.C = 0) then we call that geometry Von Karman, to honor Von Karman's contribution.
It'll look as follows(to scale):

**Here's a comparison of different nose cone geometries at different Mach Numbers:**

# OUR DESIGN:
- Starting the initial rocket design process in OpenRocket we begin with the Von Karman Geometry for the nose cone design of our rocket.
- Then in the Open Rocket's optimization window we performed optimization on the shape parameter of the Haack Series the size of the nose cone.

- Values before optimization: 25cm, c=0
- Values after optimization: 24.3cm, c=0.016

## NOW, LET'S GO WITH THIS DESIGN!
